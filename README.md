# Project Motivation
This project was done as part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. A yelp academic dataset was explored and the following questions were answered:
1. Is there a difference in the business stars by major categories (Restaurants, Shopping, Nightlife, ...)? Any differences in Restaurant categories?
2. What affects if a business will close?
3. Does vicinity to other similar business help or hurt ratings?
